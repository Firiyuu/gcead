6	Think about merging recording from another EAD file
	?	import all records from another EAD file
		test importing from both GcEad/2010 and the old EAD program
		but: also need to let user delete waves then?
x	"Load Sample Project...": remove "..."
?	Log CHECK_* messages with time
	?	Shorter date/time format
	x	Add mechanism to write more data to the log
*	Corraine's request is for EAD instead of FID
	BUG?: What happens when trying to open file directly from explorer?
	Create unit tests
	x	load sample project
	x	charts
	x	zooming
	x	scrolling
	x	edit/show wave comments
	.	peaks
			show percentage vs amplitude
	x	hiding/unhiding waves
	x	adding/removing extra waves from charts
	x	inverting a wave
	.	save/load
			wave comment with XML special characters
			file comment with XML special characters
			BUG: in Chart:All, EAG Ave doesn't remain hidden
		importing from both GcEad/2010 and the old EAD program
		publishing
		recording
			recording label shown when recording starts
			recording label updates during recording (RECORDING & REMAINING)
			recording label hidden after recording done
			chart updates during recording
			proper scrolling as recording goes off current visible region
		loading/saving settings
			show peak percent vs amplitude
	Improve handling of IDAC overflow
	Run unit tests in GUI
		separate View and ViewMain
		create ViewTest
		run with valgrind
	Create new installer for Windows
		build EXE in Windows
		update version number too

DONE:
x	In record mode, when data gets to end of screen, use page-right instead of zoom-out
x	After recording stop, re-adjust scrollbars and offset
x	Add peak amplitude
	x	Markers action
	x	Markers menu
	x	Peak options for choosing to display percent vs. amplitude
	x	ChartPixmap should respect peak option
	x	Load the user choice for peak percent vs. amplitude
	x	Save the user choice for peak percent vs. amplitude
	x	Make sure amplitude changes as we shift the handle
	x	Save amplitude to retention data export
	x	Display amplitude value and units nicely on chart
	x	Calculate amplitude when .EAD loaded
x	BUG: ChartPixmap::drawWaveformDigital, it's possible for it to lock up
x	File comment dialog needs to be wider, and it should be multiline
x	SVG saving: fix the height and width in order to eliminate all that extra blank space.
x	Create hidden test routine to record lots of waves 
	x	Test in Windows
	x	Test making 4 recordings; save file; close GeEad; reopen file; try recording more
	x	Run longer recording tests in windows
	x	Log USB error messages
	x	Run non-recording ScopeTests in valgrind
x	Show time elapsed instead of time remaining when recording


	INSTALLER:
		MAC:
			offer to start program after installation
			how to install libusb on mac? (see http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/)
			readme for mac about libusb?
		WINDOWS:
			verify libusb on vista
	IDAC2
	?	IdacDriver2: get inverted status correct
		handle 0x7ffe (or whatever the reset code is)? (only if I can look at the original code which generated/handled 0x7ffe)
		get symbolic codes for the IDAC2
	TEST:
		test that voltage conversions are done right
		test that digital stimulus channel works on IDAC2
		is the decimation value really right for IDAC2?
		run through a couple use-cases
	FOR PETER:
		USB drivers CANNOT co-exist with old drivers
		IDAC2: same signal on INPUT 2 reads about 10x smaller than on INPUT 1...
		IDAC2: when I set ext amp=1, signal on INPUT 1 is *2mV* peak to peak
		IDAC4: when I set ext amp=10, signal on INPUT 1 is *1mV* peak to peak


	CLEANUP:
	x	remove/reduce compiler warnings
	x	suppress debug output in release mode
	x	svn:eol-style=native on all relevant files
	x	copyright notices in all files
	x	svn:ignore relevant directories/files
	x	set proper app version number

	
	testing
		Verify that all menu actions are connected
		Run program through valgrind
	user documentation
	programmer documentation
	open-source it
		upload EXEs to sourceforge

FUTURE STUFF: doesn't fit in this contract, but should be done as soon as possible
	add programmer documentation to IdacDriver* projects
	log errors to a log file

FUTURE STUFF: doesn't belong in this contract, but might be done as a refinement later
	BUG: Load Sample Project, edit it, Save As over an existing file: should ask for overwrite confirmation!  Appears to be a Qt or KDE bug, because other applications have the same problem, and I think it might have worked correctly in windows -- 2010-05-05.
	integrate RecordHandler into Idac/ or IdacDriver/ (and delete RecordHandler)
	ChartPixmap: BUG: while recording, FID wave sometimes is displayed with a vertical line at the end (might have to zoom in to see the phenomenon)
	ChartWidget: vertical "crosshair" line
	ChartWidget: When changing number of horizontal divisions in Publish task, move the scrollbar appropriately
?	ChartWidget: BUG: zoom in three times, then zoom out twice, no data is shown anymore!
	ChartWidget: When the user first presses Ctrl, update the mouse cursor if appropriate (i.e., about to set a peak)
	ChartWidget: Don't let user zoom in on an empty document using mouse dragging
	EadFile: returned more detailed information when load/save fail (and show it to user)
	Globals: set whether File or Print output was last selected (variables already exist in PublisherSettings, and they are loaded and saved in Globals)
	MainScope: only enable m_actions->fileExportRetentionData when the user has set/verified peaks
	MainScope: add undo/redo
	MainWindow: when right-click on toolbar, don't give option to hide it
	MainWindow: Beep when done recording?
	PanelTabs: consider choosing equal widths for tabs, if space allows
	PanelTabs: draw shadow around active tab?
	RecordDialog: when trigger comes, somehow start saving data on EXACTLY the sample where the trigger occurred, rather than waiting for the next data block
	RecordSettingsDialog: on_sliderOffset_sliderMoved(): make it use increments of 1,000,000/0x7fff
	SweepWidget: when signal is out of range, make it visible somehow (limit to viewport?)
	TaskPublishWidget: add btnResetColors
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing the time of a recording, only print hour and minute (not seconds), but keep it localized!
	TaskPublishWidget: save user-title to EadFile
	TaskPublishWidget: pen width for signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: color of signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing in black/white, need to make peak labels b/w too
	TaskPublishWidget: Qt BUG: SVG painting doesn't clip signals above and below the viewbox properly
	TaskReviewWidget: in Recording view, let user select any EAD/FID wave he wants (not just the averages)
	TaskReviewWidget: allow adding comments to average waves
	WaveEditorWidget: add a [Delete] command
	WaveEditorWidget: add a wave color?
	WaveEditorWidget: let user edit name

	Refactor: ChartPixmap: remove knowledge of the current EadTask (perform task-specific logic via other variables)
	Refactor: ChartScope: remove knowledge of the current EadTask (perform task-specific logic via other variables)
	Refactor: MainScope: move File|Open Recent from MainWindow to MainScope
	Refactor: Task*Scope: create scope classes for the Task widgets too
	Refactor: Rename widgets for the right side: View*Widget
	Refactor: only call Globals->file()->updateAveWaves() from ViewInfo?
	Refactor: WaveInfo: vwiUser is a HACK, see if we can improve this
	Refactor: TaskReviewWidget: figure out a way to use WaveEditorWidget instead of painting everything ourselves, but still maintain smooth drawing
