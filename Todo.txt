	180 minutes default record duration
	hide GC Delay for channel 1
	INSTALLER:
		MAC:
			offer to start program after installation
			how to install libusb on mac? (see http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/)
			readme for mac about libusb?
		WINDOWS:
		x	offer to start program after installation
		?	add start menu link to homepage
		?	<associateWindowsFileExtension>
			verify libusb on vista
	IDAC2
		IdacDriver2: range values are in the wrong order
		IdacDriver2: setting the filter from the RecordSettingDialog doesn't have an effect
		IdacDriver2: get inverted status correct
		handle 0x7ffe (or whatever the reset code is)? (only if I can look at the original code which generated/handled 0x7ffe)
		get symbolic codes for the IDAC2
	TEST:
		test that voltage conversions are done right
		make sure range settings work correctly for IDAC2
		test that digital stimulus channel works on IDAC2
		is the decimation value really right for IDAC2?
		run through a couple use-cases
		when installing for LINUX as root:
		x	/usr/share/applications/GcEad.desktop works?
		x	/etc/udev/60-syntech.rules is there?
	CONCLUDE:
	x	import into sourceforge svn
	?	set proper app version number
		create installers
		upload installers to sourceforge
	FOR PETER:
		old settings will be gone for people who previously had the program installed
		USB drivers CANNOT co-exist with old drivers


	CLEANUP:
	x	remove/reduce compiler warnings
	x	suppress debug output in release mode
	x	svn:eol-style=native on all relevant files
	x	copyright notices in all files
	x	svn:ignore relevant directories/files

?	Resolve: what units should GcDelay be in?  Timeshifting is done 1 second at a time...
?	RecordDialog: start recording on trigger
	
	testing
		Verify that all menu actions are connected
		Run program through valgrind
	user documentation
	programmer documentation
	open-source it
		setup sourceforge svn
		import into sourceforge svn
		upload EXEs to sourceforge

FUTURE STUFF: doesn't fit in this contract, but should be done as soon as possible
	add programmer documentation to IdacDriver* projects
	log errors to a log file
	show USB errors in the status bar, or some perhaps via a message box
	mac: get isochronous transfer to work for IDAC4 (try libusb-1.1 when it comes out)

FUTURE STUFF: doesn't belong in this contract, but might be done as a refinement later
	integrate RecordHandler into Idac/ or IdacDriver/ (and delete RecordHandler)
	ChartPixmap: BUG: while recording, FID wave sometimes is displayed with a vertical line at the end (might have to zoom in to see the phenomenon)
	ChartWidget: vertical "crosshair" line
	ChartWidget: When changing number of horizontal divisions in Publish task, move the scrollbar appropriately
	ChartWidget: BUG: zoom in three times, then zoom out twice, no data is shown anymore!
	ChartWidget: When the user first presses Ctrl, update the mouse cursor if appropriate (i.e., about to set a peak)
	ChartWidget: Don't let user zoom in on an empty document using mouse dragging
	ChartWidget: Double-clicking the wave brings up its settings dialog (will need to assign WaveEditorFlags in ViewWaveInfo from somewhere prior to TaskReviewView so that ChartWidget can get at the flags too)
	EadFile: returned more detailed information when load/save fail (and show it to user)
	Globals: set whether File or Print output was last selected (variables already exist in PublisherSettings, and they are loaded and saved in Globals)
	MainScope: only enable m_actions->fileExportRetentionData when the user has set/verified peaks
	MainWindow: move peak FID combobox from TaskReviewWidget to the toolbar
	MainWindow: Chart menu
	MainWindow: View menu: add actions for switching the view type
	MainWindow: Beep when done recording?
	PanelTabs: consider choosing equal widths for tabs, if space allows
	PanelTabs: draw shadow around active tab?
	RecordDialog: when trigger comes, somehow start saving data on EXACTLY the sample where the trigger occurred, rather than waiting for the next data block
	RecordSettingsDialog: on_sliderOffset_sliderMoved(): make it use increments of 1,000,000/0x7fff
	SweepWidget: when signal is out of range, make it visible somehow (limit to viewport?)
	TaskPublishWidget: add btnResetColors
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing the time of a recording, only print hour and minute (not seconds), but keep it localized!
	TaskPublishWidget: save user-title to EadFile
	TaskPublishWidget: pen width for signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: color of signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing in black/white, need to make peak labels b/w too
	TaskReviewWidget: in Recording view, let user select any EAD/FID wave he wants (not just the averages)
	TaskReviewWidget: allow adding comments to average waves
	WaveEditorWidget: add a [Delete] command
	WaveEditorWidget: add a wave color?
	WaveEditorWidget: let user edit name

	Refactor: ChartScope: create a chart scope and use it for ChartWidget (rename ChartWidget to ChartView then)
	Refactor: MainScope: move File|Open Recent from MainWindow to MainScope
	Refactor: Rename widgets for the right side: View*Widget
	Refactor: only call Globals->file()->updateAveWaves() from ViewInfo?
	Refactor: WaveInfo: vwiUser is a HACK, see if we can improve this
	Refactor: TaskReviewWidget: figure out a way to use WaveEditorWidget instead of painting everything ourselves, but still maintain smooth drawing
