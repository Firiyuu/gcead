x	MainScope: Add function to export tabular peak data (rentention time, percent, area) (YES)

	Resolve: what units should GcDelay be in?  Timeshifting is done 1 second at a time...
?	RecordDialog: start recording on trigger
	
	testing
		Verify that all menu actions are connected
		Run program through valgrind
	user documentation
	programmer documentation
	open-source it
		add GPL notice to all source files
		setup sourceforge svn
		import into sourceforge svn
		create minimal page on sourceforge
		upload EXEs to sourceforge
	
FUTURE STUFF: doesn't belong in this contract, but might be done as a refinement later
	ChartPixmap: BUG: while recording, FID wave sometimes is displayed with a vertical line at the end (might have to zoom in to see the phenomenon)
	ChartWidget: vertical "crosshair" line
	ChartWidget: When changing number of horizontal divisions in Publish task, move the scrollbar appropriately
	ChartWidget: BUG: zoom in three times, then zoom out twice, no data is shown anymore!
	ChartWidget: When the user first presses Ctrl, update the mouse cursor if appropriate (i.e., about to set a peak)
	ChartWidget: Don't let user zoom in on an empty document using mouse dragging
	ChartWidget: Double-clicking the wave brings up its settings dialog (will need to assign WaveEditorFlags in ViewWaveInfo from somewhere prior to TaskReviewView so that ChartWidget can get at the flags too)
	EadFile: returned more detailed information when load/save fail (and show it to user)
	Globals: set whether File or Print output was last selected (variables already exist in PublisherSettings, and they are loaded and saved in Globals)
	MainScope: only enable m_actions->fileExportRetentionData when the user has set/verified peaks
	MainWindow: move peak FID combobox from TaskReviewWidget to the toolbar
	MainWindow: Chart menu
	MainWindow: View menu: add actions for switching the view type
	MainWindow: Beep when done recording?
	PanelTabs: consider choosing equal widths for tabs, if space allows
	PanelTabs: draw shadow around active tab?
	RecordDialog: when trigger comes, somehow start saving data on EXACTLY the sample where the trigger occurred, rather than waiting for the next data block
	RecordSettingsDialog: on_sliderOffset_sliderMoved(): make it use increments of 1,000,000/0x7fff
	SweepWidget: when signal is out of range, make it visible somehow (limit to viewport?)
	TaskPublishWidget: add btnResetColors
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing the time of a recording, only print hour and minute (not seconds), but keep it localized!
	TaskPublishWidget: save user-title to EadFile
	TaskPublishWidget: pen width for signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: color of signals (Peter's request)
	TaskPublishWidget: when printing in black/white, need to make peak labels b/w too
	TaskReviewWidget: in Recording view, let user select any EAD/FID wave he wants (not just the averages)
	TaskReviewWidget: allow adding comments to average waves
	WaveEditorWidget: add a [Delete] command
	WaveEditorWidget: add a wave color?
	WaveEditorWidget: let user edit name

	Refactor: ChartScope: create a chart scope and use it for ChartWidget (rename ChartWidget to ChartView then)
	Refactor: MainScope: move File|Open Recent from MainWindow to MainScope
	Refactor: Rename widgets for the right side: View*Widget
	Refactor: Consider how to better name the IDAC files and which directories to put them in
	Refactor: Put IdacStart in Idac/
	Refactor: only call Globals->file()->updateAveWaves() from ViewInfo?
	Refactor: WaveInfo: vwiUser is a HACK, see if we can improve this
	Refactor: TaskReviewWidget: figure out a way to use WaveEditorWidget instead of painting everything ourselves, but still maintain smooth drawing

Extra stuff not initially estimated:
			Smooth waveform drawing in Publish mode
			Digital signals
			Time marking on FID signals

Questions:
	Do we need filters to get rid of the DC signal?
	What is the typical voltage range of EAD signals? offset can be anything, +- 20-30mV
	What is the typical voltage range of FID signals? +-1V
	Does the user need to mark "areas" on both EAD and FID signals, or only on FID signals?
	Does the user ever need to mark the area *above* a curve (as opposed to only below)?
	Does timebase = 100ms make any sense?
	At what rate should the data be recorded?  It seems to be 10 samples per second in the old program.

Questions2:
	What kind of timestamps do we need on the chart?
	Algorithm for peak detection?
	Algorithm for area marking?

Questions3:
	Can I get hardware for digital trigger input?
	Timeshift: shifting one sample at a time is very slow, with a sampling rate of 100/s
