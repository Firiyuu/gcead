## libudev

On linux, you'll need to install `libudev`.  For Debian, you can run

        sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

## libusb

* linux and mac: make -f libusbx.mak
* windows: pre-compiled libraries already provided

On Windows, if you need to update the pre-compiled libaries:

* goto http://libusb.info and download the latest pre-compiled Windows binaries
* unpack the binary
* copy $BINARY/include/libusb-1.0/libusb.h to $SRC/extern/win32/libusb-1.0/libusb.h
* copy $BINARY/MinGW32/static/libusb-1.0.a to $SRC/extern/win32/libusb-1.0.a

## GcEad

I built the project with the Qt SDK for Qt 5.5.1 and Qt Creator 3.5.1.

You will find the final program, GcEad, in either the debug/ or release/
subfolders.

See Notes.txt for programmer notes.

## Register USB device (on linux only)

* Register the device.  For Debian this looks like:

        sudo cp Installables/Linux/60-syntech.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
        sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

* unplug IDAC from USB port if it's plugged in
* plug in IDAC back into the USB port
