I built the project with the Qt SDK for Qt 4.5.1 and Qt Creator 1.1.

If you also use the Qt SDK, I might suggest building the project from within 
Qt Creator in order to avoid conflicts with Qt tools and libraries installed
elsewhere on your system.

You will find the final program, GcEad, in either the debug/ or release/
subfolders.

See Notes.txt for programmer notes.
