I built the project with the Qt SDK for Qt 4.6 and Qt Creator 2.0.

You will find the final program, GcEad, in either the debug/ or release/
subfolders.

See Notes.txt for programmer notes.

sudo cp Installables/Linux/60-syntech.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

unplug IDAC from USB port if it's plugged in
plug in IDAC back into the USB port
